## Overview 

The shinyapp was developed to showcase an interactive application, using mtcars dataset.  
The application displays a boxplot of miles per gallon and highlights the mean.  
The slider is used to choose the subset of data based on Trasmission type 0 - automatic and 1 - manual.  
A choice of radio buttons help choose the color of the line used to highlight the mean MPG for the subset.

## Plot MPG vs Transmission type automatic

```{r, fig1.height=5, fig.width=5}
data(mtcars)
mtcars1 <- subset(mtcars,am == 0)
boxplot(mtcars1$mpg, ylab='Miles/(US) gallon', xlab="Transmission type automatic", col='lightblue',main='mtcars - boxplot of MPG')
abline(h=mean(mtcars1$mpg),col="red", lty=3, lwd=5)
```

## Plot MPG vs Transmission type manual

```{r, fig2.height=5, fig.width=5}
mtcars1 <- subset(mtcars,am == 1)
boxplot(mtcars1$mpg, ylab='Miles/(US) gallon', xlab="Transmission type manual", col='lightblue',main='mtcars - boxplot of MPG')
abline(h=mean(mtcars1$mpg),col="blue", lty=3, lwd=5)
```

## Summary
In the shiny application we used two widgets to demonstrate the interactive capability.  

Slider :- 
        sliderInput('type', 'Choose Transmission type:- 0 = automatic, 1 = manual',value = 0, min = 0, max = 1, step = 1),
        
Radio Button :-
        radioButtons("color", label = h3("Color"),
                     choices = list("Red" = "red",
                                    "Blue" = "blue",
                                    "Green" = "green")
                     ,selected = "red")

By combining widgets, Applications can be developed to make it interactive and engaging.
